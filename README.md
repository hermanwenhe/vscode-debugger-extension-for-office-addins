In the Office Add-in Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code, you can easily discover all applicable commands in the sidebar and Command Palette with the keyword "Office". It also supports Command Line Interface (CLI) to increase efficiency.

### Prerequisites
Verify you have the right prerequisites for building Office add-ins and install some recommended development tools. [Read more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/overview/set-up-your-dev-environment).

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 16, 18, or 20 (18 is preferred) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).** To verify if you've already installed these tools, run the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
- **Office connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription.** You might qualify for a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription through the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](
https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program), see [FAQ](
https://learn.microsoft.com/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#who-qualifies-for-a-microsoft-365-e5-developer-subscription-) for details.
Alternatively, you can [sign up for a 1-month free trial](

### Create your add-in
Use the Office Add-in Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code to set up your first add-in project. Create your Office add-in project using the following steps:

* Ensure you've installed the `Microsoft Office Add-in Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code`.
* Select the `Office Add-in Dev Kit` icon in the Visual Studio Code sidebar.
* Select `Create a New Add-in` button from the sidebar.
* Select an Office app that you want to build the add-in for.
* Select an add-in template from the list of available templates.
* Select JavaScript/TypeScript as the programming language.
* Choose a location where your new add-in will be created in a new folder.
* Type a name for your project and hit Enter.

### Configure your add-in

An Office add-in includes two basic components: an XML manifest file, and your own web application. 
* The manifest defines various settings, including how your add-in integrates with Office clients. 
* Your web application needs to be hosted on a web server, or web hosting service, such as Microsoft Azure.

When a add-in project is created, you can explore and customize the components by reviewing the key files listed below.

- The `./manifest.xml` file in the root directory of the project defines the settings and capabilities of the add-in.  <br>You can check whether your manifest file is valid by selecting `Validate Manifest File` in the `Office Add-in Dev Kit` extension tree view.
- The `./src/taskpane/taskpane.html` file contains the HTML markup for the task pane.
- The `./src/taskpane/taskpane.css` file contains the CSS that's applied to content in the task pane.
- The `./src/taskpane/taskpane.js` file contains the Office JavaScript API code that facilitates interaction between the task pane and the Word application.

### Preview your add-in in Office apps

To understand how the add-in will work in Office apps, you can use the Office Add-in Dev Kit to easily run and debug your Office add-in in your local dev environment.

#### Check and Install Dependencies
Select `Check and Install Dependencies` to check your environment and install necessary dependencies in order to run and debug the add-in code.

#### Preview Your Office Add-in (F5)

Select `Preview Your Office Add-in(F5)` on the side panel to start running and debugging the add-in code. A Word/Excel/PowerPoint app will launch with the add-in sample side-loaded.
- You can also start debugging by hitting the `F5` key or running `npm run start` command in the terminal.
- To debug on Office on the web, go to [Sideload Office Add-ins to Office on the web](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing)
- To debug in Desktop (Edge Legacy), go to [Debug Edge Legacy Webview](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/debug-add-ins-using-devtools-edge-legacy)

#### Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in

Select `Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in` to stop debugging.
